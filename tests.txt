"They are trying to make it illegal to question the results of a bad election." Trump did much more than question results. If he had stopped there or at lawful strategies such as filing lawsuits or requesting audits, he wouldn’t be in this situation. The Aug. 1 indictment introduction says, "The defendant had a right, like every American, to speak publicly about the election and even to claim, falsely, that there had been outcome-determinative fraud during the election and that he won." The four charges against Trump are about actions meant to overturn results.The indictment says Trump "pursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results," amounting to criminal conspiracies. In paragraph after paragraph, the indictment details actions Trump took to achieve the goal of the conspiracy."This is all conduct, not speech," said E. Danya Perry, a white-collar criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor in New York. The indictment alleges Trump took specific actions to further the conspiracy, including:His call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger imploring him to "find" more votes to put Trump in the winning column.His role in the pressure campaign on legislators in battleground states he had lost as he sought to sway them to overturn the election.Along with his campaign and co-conspirators, seeking to establish fake electors and have them transmit certificates showing Trump won in states he lost.Attempting to "leverage the Justice Department to use deceit" to replace legitimate electors with fake Trump electors.Seeking to enlist Vice President Mike Pence to "fraudulently alter the election results" on Jan. 6.When contacted for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson pointed to the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech and the right of people to "petition the government for a redress of grievances." The indictment uses scathing criticism of Trump’s speech after the 2020 election, saying he "spread lies" about election fraud and "knew that they were false." Trump created an "intense national atmosphere of mistrust and anger," it says.However, the allegations detailed in the indictment were not a matter of free speech, lawyers said.'
