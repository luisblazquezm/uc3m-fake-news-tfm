    "### PLAN OF ACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the dataset, i.e. combine it into one, and create true / false labels\n",
    "- Then, utilizing HuggingFace's Transformers library, retrieve the pre-trained BERT model to use as the foundation of a Fake News Detection Model. BERT has incredible language understanding abilities. As a result, it will help the model better grasp news context and hence generate educated predictions about whether news is false or not - The Base Model and general architecture are then defined. For example, we may use PyTorch to define, train, and evaluate neural network models.\n",
    "- After that, we freeze the weights on the BERT beginning layers. If we do not accomplish this, we will lose all of our past knowledge.\n",
    "- Next, we add new Trainable Layers. In general, feature extraction layers are the only information from the basic model that we utilize. We must add additional layers on top of the model to forecast its particular jobs. Furthermore, we establish a new output layer because the pre-trained model's ultimate output will almost definitely differ from the result we desire for our model, which is binary 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The final stage is to fine-tune our model. Making minor tweaks to the model to improve it.\n",
    "- After that, we use our Fake News Detection Model on unseen data to create predictions."

    "The dataframe contains around 40.000 records, with somewhat more bogus news. We don't need to use any unbalanced data treatment strategies like upsampling because the difference is so small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feeding the model selection pipeline with more than 40.000 records, each of which has 750 words or more, may result in a RAM memory overflow. A easy method is to choose a smaller percentage of the records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas provides an easy-to-use command that allows the developer to sample a defined number of records while creating a random_state for repeatability of findings. I chose 3000 records since it is an arbitrary amount that represents slightly less than 10% of the dataframe and should not create RAM overflow."
